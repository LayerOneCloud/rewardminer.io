NOTES:</br>
</br>
</br>
 A completed KYC as per LayerOne's standards is considered the one of the main safety factors in any project.  If this project has KYC's for all members with controlling wallets then we consider the project to be safe from potential rugging (a "rug" or "rugging" is fraud from within the team).</br>
</br>
Why is a project with a team KYC by LayerOne considered the safest kind of prject?</br>
</br>
 Our team of cybersecurity professionals along with the Counsel of International Investigators (CII) have a track record of finding criminals and cryptocurrency recovery.  CII is a group of over 400 internationally licensed private investigators in 72 countries.</br>
</br>
 If this project/person(s) has completed a full KYC with us, we have their home address and government ID in our vault (securely stored).  Should a crime be established (a rug), and if a legal mandate is issued we can have boots on the ground in almost any country within 24-48hrs to track and arrest where possible.  NOTE: KYC information is stored securely in accordance with GDPR, POPIA and other international standards for privacy law.  It's sole use is to validate who a person is and we can only reveal this personal information for legal purposes and no other.</br>
